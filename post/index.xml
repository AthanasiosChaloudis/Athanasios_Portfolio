      <description>This work was part of a 6-month University Project. The core assignment was to scrape data from the known Wikipedia website, process and analyse the data and present the visualised data in a way the results can be clear and understanding. For this project a team of 4 was formed and my role was the Pre-Processing of the data in Python and the Visualization of the results in Tableau. Here we can see a summary of the work.</description>

      <description>For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning.</description>
