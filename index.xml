      <description>This work was part of a 6-month University Project. The core assignment was to scrape data from the known Wikipedia website, process and analyse the data and present the visualised data in a way the results can be clear and understanding. For this project a team of 4 was formed and my role was the Pre-Processing of the data in Python and the Visualization of the results in Tableau. Here we can see a summary of the work.</description>

      <description>This is an ongoing work, started in early October 2020 and will be delivered by the beginning of February 2021. This work is under the supervision and coordination of the University of Hamburg. Latest update : 11.12.2020
Recommender Systems or recommendation systems (sometimes replacing ‚system‘ with a synonym such as ‚platform‘ or ‚engine‘) are an evolving part of the modern industry’s toolbox, focused on customer acquisition, churn management, and revenue improvement.</description>

      <description>This was a project assigned to me by the University of Hamburg for a Data Science Module. The official name of the project was &amp;ldquo;Data Science for Web-Applications&amp;rdquo;. The focus of our analysis was to analyse a given dataset of a telecommunications company, which contained data describing their customers (sorted by UID&amp;rsquo;s). Some example features were:
 Gender Age Tenure ContractType (monthly,yearly,2years) PaymentMethod (creditCard, directDebit, cash-in-shop) Churn  The features describing the customers contained different data types and structures, some values were missing and some imported in varying styles (e.</description>

      <description>For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning.</description>
